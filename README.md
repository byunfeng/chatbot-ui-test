### 4. Integrations Supabase With Vercel

On the "Settings" page, navigate to the "Integrations" section to integrate Supabase into your project.

### 5. Supabase.com Settingã€‚

After creating an account and a new project, go to the project settings (on Supabase.com)and click on "SQL Editor."

Enter and run the SQL query statements from the files in the `\chatbot-ui\supabase\migrations` directory sequentially into the command line within the SQL Editor.

In the 1st migration file 20240108234540_setup.sql, you will need to replace 2 values: `project_url` (line 53) and `service_role_key`(line 54), which can be found in the project settings on Supabase.com.

```bash
20240108234540_setup.sql
20240108234541_add_profiles.sql
20240108234542_add_workspaces.sql
20240108234543_add_folders.sql
20240108234544_add_files.sql
20240108234545_add_file_items.sql
20240108234546_add_presets.sql
20240108234547_add_assistants.sql
20240108234548_add_chats.sql
20240108234549_add_messages.sql
20240108234550_add_prompts.sql
20240108234551_add_collections.sql
```

For example, copy and paste the SQL queries into the SQL Editor and run them.

```sql
-- Enable HTTP extension
create extension http with schema extensions;

-- Enable vector extension
create extension vector with schema extensions;

-- Function to update modified column
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = now(); 
    RETURN NEW; 
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

-- Function to delete a message and all following messages
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_message_including_and_after(
    p_user_id UUID, 
    p_chat_id UUID, 
    p_sequence_number INT
)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM messages 
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id AND chat_id = p_chat_id AND sequence_number >= p_sequence_number;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Function to create duplicate messages for a new chat
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_duplicate_messages_for_new_chat(old_chat_id UUID, new_chat_id UUID, new_user_id UUID)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO messages (user_id, chat_id, content, role, model, sequence_number, tokens, created_at, updated_at)
    SELECT new_user_id, new_chat_id, content, role, model, sequence_number, tokens, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    FROM messages
    WHERE chat_id = old_chat_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Policy to allow users to read their own files
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to read their own files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid()::text = owner_id::text);

-- Function to delete a storage object
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_storage_object(bucket TEXT, object TEXT, OUT status INT, OUT content TEXT)
RETURNS RECORD
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql'
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  project_url TEXT := 'http://yourproject_url(please change it)';
  service_role_key TEXT := 'service_role_key(please change it)'; -- full access needed for http request to storage
  url TEXT := project_url || '/storage/v1/object/' || bucket || '/' || object;
BEGIN
  SELECT
      INTO status, content
           result.status::INT, result.content::TEXT
      FROM extensions.http((
    'DELETE',
    url,
    ARRAY[extensions.http_header('authorization','Bearer ' || service_role_key)],
    NULL,
    NULL)::extensions.http_request) AS result;
END;
$$;

-- Function to delete a storage object from a bucket
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_storage_object_from_bucket(bucket_name TEXT, object_path TEXT, OUT status INT, OUT content TEXT)
RETURNS RECORD
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql'
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  SELECT
      INTO status, content
           result.status, result.content
      FROM public.delete_storage_object(bucket_name, object_path) AS result;
END;
$$;
```
